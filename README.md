# pomodoro
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the basic structure of the app, including a timer display and control buttons for starting and resetting the timer. The CSS file (pomodoro.css) is used to design a clean and minimal interface with proper alignment, styling, and an easy-to-read timer display. The JavaScript file (pomodoro.js) adds functionality by running a countdown timer, updating the time dynamically on the screen, and handling start and reset actions. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as timer functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling in a simple and practical way.
